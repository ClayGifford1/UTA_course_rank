# Say hello to our UTA Course Rank Google Chrome Extension!
# UTA_course_rank
   A Chrome extension that allows UTA students to access information from past years student surveys while picking classes in MyMav. It will show 6 seperate scores: Availability, Clarity, Communication, Encouragement, Preparedness, and Overall Score.
# Description
   The Chrome Extension will run scripts when the extension sees the user has navigated to https://mymav.utshare.utsystem.edu/. There will be an indicator that will say when it is active or not (in the form of a colored dot. Green is when it is active). The scripts currently will display the 6 UTA IER ratings of each professor next to the professor's name under the search and enroll tab.
